# Helio-centric astrology, with sidereal dates
We live on Earth, and at night we can see constellations. *The Zodiac* is a group of those constellations, which are seen both from the Northern and Southern hemispheres of Earth at the same moment, especially at astronomical midnight (when the Earth is facing a direction in the opposite side from the Sun).

Facing the South (if you are on the Northern hemisphere) at *astronomical midnight* – allows you to see which (of the constellations) is the *nearest* to the Earth. Using the “[Stellarium](http://stellarium.org/)” application – I can simulate the view onto that parametered sky, see the antisolar point and how it crosses the meridian line of Earth.
